## IoT System

The former system employs an ESP32 Microcontroller integrated with an MQ3 Alcohol Sensor and a Relay module to detect alcohol levels in breath. Programmed for synchronized functioning, it showcases results on the NETPIE Dashboard and sends notifications. If alcohol levels exceed a predefined threshold, it prevents the vehicle's engine from starting. Additionally, a push button is incorporated to activate the sensor or reset the system. For the real-time analytics project initially envisioned to use NETPIE for dashboarding and notifications, transitioning to AWS services can enhance scalability, security, and integration capabilities, particularly for IoT applications.

## Benefits of using AWS compared to Netpie

In the exploration of cloud platforms suitable for IoT applications, an analysis was conducted comparing AWS (Amazon Web Services) IoT Core and NetPIE. This comparison sought to understand the capabilities, scalability, security measures, and integration potential of each platform, highlighting the areas where AWS IoT Core often surpasses NetPIE, particularly for projects with extensive scalability and complex integration needs. The findings are presented from a passive assignment submission perspective, emphasizing the inherent strengths of AWS IoT Core in various dimensions.

### Scalability and Reliability

The investigation revealed that AWS IoT Core is inherently capable of supporting a significant scale of operations, accommodating billions of devices and trillions of messages effortlessly. Its infrastructure is designed for high availability and redundancy, crucial for the rapid scaling of IoT applications. In contrast, while NetPIE is adept at handling many applications, its scalability does not parallel the enterprise-level capabilities offered by AWS.

### Integration with Cloud Services and Ecosystem

AWS IoT Core's seamless integration with a broad array of AWS services stands out as a significant advantage. This integration facilitates the development of complex IoT solutions that can leverage advanced analytics, machine learning, and storage services directly within the AWS ecosystem. On the other hand, NetPIE, although it offers integration capabilities, lacks the extensive ecosystem provided by AWS.

### Security

The analysis highlighted the robust security features of AWS IoT Core, including mutual authentication, fine-grained authorization, and encryption, both at rest and in transit. The comprehensive and continuously audited security model of AWS IoT Core provides a level of security assurance that is paramount for IoT projects, especially those handling sensitive data.

### Developer Tools and Community Support

The vast AWS developer community and the plethora of documentation, tutorials, forums, and professional support options available were identified as significant benefits. AWS offers IoT-specific developer tools that facilitate device management, simulation, and testing, advantages that are less pronounced with NetPIE due to its smaller scale community and support resources.

### Global Infrastructure

For projects targeting a global audience, AWS IoT Core's extensive data center presence around the world offers a strategic advantage, enabling localized data processing and adherence to regional data privacy regulations. This global infrastructure is a critical factor for applications requiring low latency and compliance with local data laws, areas where NetPIE may not provide the same level of support.

### Cost and Pricing Model

While AWS IoT Core operates on a pay-as-you-go pricing model, offering cost-effectiveness at scale, careful management of resources is required to optimize expenses. The transparency in AWS pricing aids in effective planning and cost management, an aspect that may be more straightforward with NetPIE's pricing structure, particularly for smaller or initial-stage projects.

### IoT Rule

It is a rule that filters, transforms, and triggers actions based on MQTT messages and works as a bridge between IoT core and Lambda.

### Lambda Functions

Several Lambda functions are used here. One is used for controlling the car ignition through an API Gateway. It publishes a message with the desired servo angle to the MQTT topic esp32/control. Another Lambda function processes incoming data, potentially logging it to DynamoDB and sending an alert if the alcohol level is above a threshold. Another has been utilized to display and monitor live sensor data and location data on IoT Sitewise portal.

### API Gateway

It acts as an intermediary that triggers the Lambda function in response to HTTP requests.
